# io-mazegen

*This is a project originally developed in 2016, when I was in middle school. It should work with modern Python out of the box, except for Cython.*
*Later used for https://github.com/jbachurski/hornchen*

A tree maze generation algorithm with a randomised grid search. `main.py` runs an animation. Requires `pygame` to run the animation.
